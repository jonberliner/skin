### setup
+ run `chmod +x setup.sh; source setup.sh`
+ **NOTE**: `setup.sh` has a specific commit it's attached to. there's a good chance I'll forget to update this in the future, as pyt is going through rapid changes.  should prob have a better solution than this, or some reminder to remember to update the matching commit.
### Files
+ **model.py** - has the conv regression model with an example running over mnist.
  + should work with skin with a resize of model specs
